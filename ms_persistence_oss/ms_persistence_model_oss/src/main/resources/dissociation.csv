"MS:1000133","collision-induced dissociation","CAD|CID|collisionally activated dissociation","The dissociation of an ion after collisional excitation. The term collisional-activated dissociation is not recommended."
"MS:1000134","plasma desorption","PD","The ionization of material in a solid sample by bombarding it with ionic or neutral atoms formed as a result of the fission of a suitable nuclide, typically 252Cf. Synonymous with fission fragment ionization."
"MS:1000135","post-source decay","PSD","A technique specific to reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometers where product ions of metastable transitions or collision-induced dissociations generated in the drift tube prior to entering the reflectron are m/z separated to yield product ion spectra."
"MS:1000136","surface-induced dissociation","SID","Fragmentation that results from the collision of an ion with a surface."
"MS:1000242","blackbody infrared radiative dissociation","BIRD","A special case of infrared multiphoton dissociation wherein excitation of the reactant ion is caused by absorption of infrared photons radiating from heated blackbody surroundings, which are usually the walls of a vacuum chamber. See also infrared multiphoton dissociation."
"MS:1000250","electron capture dissociation","ECD","A process in which a multiply protonated molecules interacts with a low energy electrons. Capture of the electron leads the liberation of energy and a reduction in charge state of the ion with the production of the (M + nH) (n-1)+ odd electron ion, which readily fragments."
"MS:1000262","infrared multiphoton dissociation","IRMPD","Multiphoton ionization where the reactant ion dissociates as a result of the absorption of multiple infrared photons."
"MS:1000282","sustained off-resonance irradiation","SORI","A technique associated with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry to carry out ion/neutral reactions such as low-energy collision-induced dissociation. A radio-frequency electric field of slightly off-resonance to the cyclotron frequency of the reactant ion cyclically accelerates and decelerates the reactant ion that is confined in the Penning ion trap. The ion's orbit does not exceed the dimensions of ion trap while the ion undergoes an ion/neutral species process that produces a high average translational energy for an extended time."
"MS:1000422","beam-type collision-induced dissociation","HCD","A collision-induced dissociation process that occurs in a beam-type collision cell."
"MS:1000433","low-energy collision-induced dissociation","","A collision-induced dissociation process wherein the precursor ion has the translational energy lower than approximately 1000 eV. This process typically requires multiple collisions and the collisional excitation is cumulative."
"MS:1000435","photodissociation","MPD|multiphoton dissociation","A process wherein the reactant ion is dissociated as a result of absorption of one or more photons."
"MS:1000598","electron transfer dissociation","ETD","A process to fragment ions in a mass spectrometer by inducing fragmentation of cations (e.g. peptides or proteins) by transferring electrons from radical-anions."
"MS:1000599","pulsed q dissociation","PQD","A process that involves precursor ion activation at high Q, a time delay to allow the precursor to fragment, then a rapid pulse to low Q where all fragment ions are trapped. The product ions can then be scanned out of the ion trap and detected."
"MS:1001880","in-source collision-induced dissociation","","The dissociation of an ion as a result of collisional excitation during ion transfer from an atmospheric pressure ion source and the mass spectrometer vacuum."
"MS:1002000","LIFT","","A Bruker's proprietary technique where molecular ions are initially accelerated at lower energy, then collide with inert gas in a collision cell that is then 'lifted' to high potential. The use of inert gas is optional, as it could lift also fragments provided by LID."
"MS:1002472","trap-type collision-induced dissociation","","A collision-induced dissociation process that occurs in a trap-type collision cell."
"MS:1002481","higher energy beam-type collision-induced dissociation","","A collision-induced dissociation process wherein the projectile ion has the translational energy higher than approximately 1000 eV."
"MS:1002631","electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation","EThcD","Dissociation process combining electron-transfer dissociation and higher-energy collision dissociation. It combines ETD (reaction time) followed by HCD (activation energy)."
