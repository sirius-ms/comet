"MS:1000078","axial ejection linear ion trap","","A linear ion trap mass spectrometer where ions are ejected along the axis of the analyzer."
"MS:1000079","fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer","FT_ICR","A mass spectrometer based on the principle of ion cyclotron resonance in which an ion in a magnetic field moves in a circular orbit at a frequency characteristic of its m/z value. Ions are coherently excited to a larger radius orbit using a pulse of radio frequency energy and their image charge is detected on receiver plates as a time domain signal. Fourier transformation of the time domain signal results in a frequency domain signal which is converted to a mass spectrum based in the inverse relationship between frequency and m/z."
"MS:1000080","magnetic sector","","A device that produces a magnetic field perpendicular to a charged particle beam that deflects the beam to an extent that is proportional to the particle momentum per unit charge. For a monoenergetic beam, the deflection is proportional to m/z."
"MS:1000081","quadrupole","","A mass spectrometer that consists of four parallel rods whose centers form the corners of a square and whose opposing poles are connected. The voltage applied to the rods is a superposition of a static potential and a sinusoidal radio frequency potential. The motion of an ion in the x and y dimensions is described by the Matthieu equation whose solutions show that ions in a particular m/z range can be transmitted along the z axis."
"MS:1000082","quadrupole ion trap","QIT|Paul Ion trap|Quistor","Quadrupole Ion Trap mass analyzer captures the ions in a three dimensional ion trap and then selectively ejects them by varying the RF and DC potentials."
"MS:1000083","radial ejection linear ion trap","","A linear ion trap mass spectrometer where ions are ejected along the radius of the analyzer."
"MS:1000084","time-of-flight","TOF","Instrument that separates ions by m/z in a field-free region after acceleration to a fixed acceleration energy."
"MS:1000254","electrostatic energy analyzer","ESA","A device consisting of conducting parallel plates, concentric cylinders or concentric spheres that separates charged particles according to their kinetic energy by means of an electric field that is constant in time."
"MS:1000264","ion trap","IT","A device for spatially confining ions using electric and magnetic fields alone or in combination."
"MS:1000284","stored waveform inverse fourier transform","SWIFT","A technique to create excitation waveforms for ions in FT-ICR mass spectrometer or Paul ion trap. An excitation waveform in the time-domain is generated by taking the inverse Fourier transform of an appropriate frequency-domain programmed excitation spectrum, in which the resonance frequencies of ions to be excited are included. This technique may be used for selection of precursor ions in MS2 experiments."
"MS:1000288","cyclotron","","A device that uses an oscillating electric field and magnetic field to accelerate charged particles."
"MS:1000291","linear ion trap","","A two dimensional Paul ion trap in which ions are confined in the axial dimension by means of an electric field at the ends of the trap."
"MS:1000484","orbitrap","","An ion trapping device that consists of an outer barrel-like electrode and a coaxial inner spindle-like electrode that form an electrostatic field with quadro-logarithmic potential distribution. The frequency of harmonic oscillations of the orbitally trapped ions along the axis of the electrostatic field is independent of the ion velocity and is inversely proportional to the square root of m/z so that the trap can be used as a mass analyzer."
"MS:1003379","asymmetric track lossless time-of-flight analyzer","Astral","A TOF-like mass analyzer with asymmetric ion mirrors to direct ions into transversal asymmetric oscillations and ion foil shapes and maintains ion packet for transmission and resolution."
