Link from annotated fragment peak to its parent fragment peak connected by their neutral loss.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**parentIdx** | **Integer** | Index to the parent peak connected by this loss in this particular spectrum |  |
|**parentFragmentId** | **Integer** | Identifier of the parent fragment connected via this loss. Can be used to map fragments and peaks  among fragmentation trees and spectra. |  |
